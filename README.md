## Introduction
This project utilizes the Nvidia self-driving model to simulate a self-driving car. The model processes input data to make driving decisions in a simulated environment, showcasing the potential of autonomous driving technology.

## Features
- **Nvidia Model:** Leveraging the Nvidia architecture for efficient and accurate driving simulations.
- **Low Loss Value:** Achieved a loss of **0.1165**, indicating good performance in the training process.
- **Modular Code Structure:** The code is organized for clarity and ease of use.

## Requirements
Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example `requirements.txt`
```plaintext
opencv-contrib-python
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
keras
python-socketio
Flask
eventlet
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is located in the `Data/` folder. Ensure that all required data files are available in this directory for the simulation to work properly.

## Usage

### Running the Simulation
To run the self-driving car simulation, execute the main script:

```bash
python self_driving_car.py
```

This script will initialize the simulation and run the self-driving model, utilizing the data in the `data/` folder.

## Assumptions
- Based on the achieved loss of **0.1165**, it can be assumed that the model has a reasonable accuracy, likely above **85%**, depending on the specific dataset and evaluation criteria used.
- The actual accuracy may vary based on the complexity of the driving environment and the quality of the training data.
